# Contribute to Uberlab

We're glad you read this and want to participate in our sweet little laboratory. Our goal is to provide a platform where users can teach and learn from each other and show what's possible with Uberspace.

You're very welcome to add your own guides to this repository. Also whenever you think something is not working as documented or a guide is not self-explaining please let us know.

Before you begin writing:

 - To signify intent and prevent duplicate work, please create an issue **before** working on your pull request.
 - Check out our [style guide](https://github.com/Uberspace/lab/blob/master/STYLE.md).
 
## Reward

For every guide that makes it to the Uberlab you get an Uberspace mug that you can't buy anywhere:

Also you'll be mentioned in the [hall of fame](https://lab.uberspace.de/en/hall_of_fame.html).

## Our Standards

Be excellent to each other.
