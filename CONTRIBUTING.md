# Contribute to Uberlab

We're glad you read this and want to participate in our sweet little laboratory. Our goal is to provide a platform where users can teach and learn from each other and show what's possible with Uberspace.

You're very welcome to add your own guides to this repository. Also whenever you think something is not working as documented or a guide is not self-explaining please let us know.

Before you begin writing:

-   To signify intent and prevent duplicate work, please create an issue **before** working on your pull request.
-   We know that CentOS 7 is old, we are working with full force on a successor for Uberspace 7 on a modern system. Please do not create guides where you compile software yourself. This also applies to compilers like GCC or similar.
-   Check out our [style guide](STYLE.md).

## News Feed

If you want to stay informed of changes to your guide or a guide in your interest you can subscribe to its commit feed.
e.g. for Nextcloud it would be: https://github.com/Uberspace/lab/commits/main/source/guide_nextcloud.rst.atom

## Reward

For every guide that makes it to the Uberlab you get an Uberspace goodie that you can't buy anywhere and when they're gone they're gone. You can find the rewards we currently offer in [our secret voucher only goodie store](https://pretix.eu/uberspace/shirts/).

Also you'll be mentioned in the [hall of fame](https://lab.uberspace.de/en/hall_of_fame.html).
