## Rules for guides

You're welcome to add your own guides to this repository.

Please follow our rules to keep the guides maintainable and consistent.

 * Guides have to be written in [reST](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html).
 * Use English language. You don't have to be a native speaker or a poet.
 * Upload a logo to `_static/images/`, find or create a PNG file with transparent background.
 * Don't use URLs with actual versions. Change the version to something like 42.23.1 and tell where to find the actual version instead.
 * Always use the same username `isabell`.
 * Always use the same hostname `stardust`. For bash snippets, use `[isabell@stardust ~]`.
 * Always use full paths in commands. Don't assume the home directory or the html folder.
 * Don't mention additional document roots. *Keep it simple*. Don't use subfolders. Always use the standard document root `~/html`. Always assume the document root is empty.
 * If any applications need to bind to one or more ports (like Node.js apps), use port 9000 - 9010 in your examples, which are never free on our servers.
 * Use the templates in `source/includes/` where appropriate.
 * Document all steps for setup. E.g. [create a database](https://github.com/Uberspace/lab/issues/39) when that's necessary. [Create directories](https://github.com/Uberspace/lab/issues/36) when needed.
 * When there is a license needed for the software mention it.
 * If there are interactive shell sessions, emphasize the lines that expect input from the user. For example:

```
.. code-block:: console
 :emphasize-lines: 1,2,3,12,13,14,15,16,25

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ mkdir ~/ghost
 [isabell@stardust ~]$ cd ~/ghost
 [isabell@stardust ghost]$ ghost install --no-stack --no-setup-linux-user --no-setup-systemd --no-setup-nginx --no-setup-mysql
 ✔ Checking system Node.js version
 ✔ Checking current folder permissions
 ℹ Checking operating system compatibility [skipped]
 ✔ Checking for a MySQL installation
 ✔ Checking for latest Ghost version
 ✔ Setting up install directory
 ✔ Downloading and installing Ghost v1.21.2
 ✔ Finishing install process
 ? Enter your blog URL: https://isabell.uber.space
 ? Enter your MySQL hostname: localhost
 ? Enter your MySQL username: isabell
 ? Enter your MySQL password: [hidden]
 ? Enter your Ghost database name: isabell_ghost
 ✔ Configuring Ghost
 ✔ Setting up instance
 ℹ Setting up "ghost" mysql user [skipped]
 ℹ Setting up Nginx [skipped]
 Task ssl depends on the 'nginx' stage, which was skipped.
 ℹ Setting up SSL [skipped]
 ℹ Setting up Systemd [skipped]
 ✔ Running database migrations
 ? Do you want to start Ghost? No
 [isabell@stardust ghost]$
```

 * Always end your console code blocks with `[isabell@stardust ~]$`.
 * If you use flags, explain them. Don't use short flags, always use the long versions. We want everybody to be able to know what they're doing. Example:

```
Since the installer expects to be run with root privileges, we need to adjust some settings_:

  * ``--no-stack``: Disables the system stack check during setup. Since we're a shared hosting provider, the stack is maintained by us.
  * ``-no-setup-linux-user``: Skips creating a linux user. You can't do that without root privileges.
  * ``--no-setup-systemd``: Skips creation of a systemd unit file. We'll use supervisord_ later instead.
  * ``--no-setup-nginx``: Skips webserver configuration. We'll use a htaccess_ file for apache_ later instead.
  * ``--no-setup-mysql``: Skips setup of MySQL_. You can't do that without root privileges.
```

 * Try to find an RSS feed for updates and document it.
 * If there are any standard passwords, tell the user to change them *immediately*.
 * If there are files to edit, don't do stuff like `cat > ~/.npmrc <<__EOF__`, just tell the user to _edit_ the file. Don't mention an editor like `vi` or `nano`. Example:

```
Create ``~/etc/services.d/ghost.ini`` with the following content:

.. warning:: Replace ``<username>`` with your username!

.. code-block:: ini

 [program:ghost]
 directory=/home/<username>/ghost
 command=env NODE_ENV=production /bin/node current/index.js

In our example this would be:

.. code-block:: ini

 [program:ghost]
 directory=/home/isabell/ghost
 command=env NODE_ENV=production /bin/node current/index.js
```

Please use the following structure. Only document applicable steps, leave out headlines you don't need.

 * Short description
 * Prerequisites
 * Installation
 * Configuration
 * Finishing installation
 * Best practices
 * Tuning
 * Updates

.. note:: For this guide you should be familiar with the basic concepts of

  * Node.js_ and its package manager npm_
  * MySQL_
  * supervisord_
  * domains_

License

Prerequisites
=============

We're using Node.js_ in the stable version 8:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace tools version show node
 Using 'Node.js' version: '8'
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

You'll need your MySQL credentials_. Get them with ``my_print_defaults``:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ my_print_defaults client
 --default-character-set=utf8mb4
 --user=isabell
 --password=MySuperSecretPassword
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Your blog URL needs to be setup:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace web domain list
 isabell.uber.space
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Installation
