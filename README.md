# Lab

The UberLab aims to provide various tutorials on how to
setup tools and software inside an uberspace on U7.

## Development

Pushing for each and every change is fun, but can take some
time. To speed up your development process, the lab can
be built locally.

### Initial Setup

```shell
$ virtualenv venv --python=python3.6
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building

```shell
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ make html
```

The HTML views are now present in `build/html`.
