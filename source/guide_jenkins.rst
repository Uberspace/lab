Jenkins_ is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins_ helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, TD/OMS, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands. The creator of Jenkins_ is Kohsuke Kawaguchi. Released under the MIT License, Jenkins_ is free software.

Builds can be triggered by various means, for example by commit in a version control system, by scheduling via a cron-like mechanism and by requesting a specific build URL. It can also be triggered after the other builds in the queue have completed. Jenkins_ functionality can be extended with plugins.

License
=======

Jenkins_ is released under the `MIT License <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

We're using java version 8 or 11 (9, 10 and 12 are currently not supported) `Supported Java Versionshttps://jenkins.io/doc/administration/requirements/java/`_.

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ java -version
 openjdk version "1.8.0_212"
 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-b04)
 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b04, mixed mode)
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Installation
============

Create Workspace
----------------

First create a folder called Jenkins_ and a subfolder called jenkins_home.
jenkins_home will hold all your Jenkins's data.

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ mkdir ~/Jenkins/jenkins_home -p
 [isabell@stardust ~]$


Download Jenkins_
-----------------

Next we download the current version of Jenkins_:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ wget -O Jenkins/jenkins.war http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war/latest/jenkins.war
 [isabell@stardust ~]$


At this point you would already be able to run Jenkins_, but you wouldn't be able to connect to it and it would not run as a service.

Speaking of service:

Configurtation
==============

Install service
---------------

We create the service file ~/etc/services.d/jenkins.ini and fill it with:

::

 [program:jenkins]
 directory=%(ENV_HOME)s/Jenkins/jenkins_home
 command=java -jar ../jenkins.war --httpPort=[yourPort]

Remember to replace [yourPort] with the port you want to use (8080 is the default, but you can really use anything you'd like between 1024 and 65535).

After that refresh and update the daemons and check if everything worked out:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ supervisorctl reread
 jenkins: available
 [isabell@stardust ~]$ supervisorctl update
 jenkins: added process group
 [isabell@stardust ~]$ supervisorctl status
 jenkins                          RUNNING   pid XXXXX, uptime X:XX:XX
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Your Jenkins is now up and running as a service. If your service doesn't come up you might have a problem with your port. Go back one step and use another. Remember to have it between 1024 and 65535.

Finally we'll setup our connection to the rest of the world.

Setup Web backend
-----------------

For this we add an uberspace web backend for http and our chosen port.
If you want to set a subdomain for Jenkins_ like jenkins.yourdomain.de or ci.yourdomain.de you'd have to add that before you can use it via :manual_anchor:`Domains <web-domains.html#setup>`. 

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace web backend set ci.yourdomain.de --http --port [yourPort]
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Finishing Installation
======================

First connect and initial password
----------------------------------

Now you can go to ci.yourdomain.de and see the Jenkins_ asking for your initial password. Normally this would show up in the logs or stdout of the war, but we don't need that as it is also stored in ~/Jenkins/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword.

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ cat jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
 SOMEHEXTHATIWONTTELLYOU
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Just copy and paste that and you'll be good to go. Just follow the setup and everything should work out.

Updates
=======

Do jump to a new version just replace the old war with the new version.
