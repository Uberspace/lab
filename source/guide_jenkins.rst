Jenkins

.. tag_list::

Jenkins_ is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, TD/OMS, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands. The creator of Jenkins is Kohsuke Kawaguchi. Released under the MIT License, Jenkins is free software.

Builds can be triggered by various means, for example by commit in a version control system, by scheduling via a cron-like mechanism and by requesting a specific build URL. It can also be triggered after the other builds in the queue have completed. Jenkins functionality can be extended with plugins.

License
=======

Jenkins is released under the `MIT License <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

We're using java version 8 or 11 `(9, 10 and 12 are currently not supported) <https://jenkins.io/doc/administration/requirements/java/>`_.

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ java -version
 openjdk version "1.8.0_212"
 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-b04)
 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b04, mixed mode)
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Your URL needs to be setup:

.. include:: includes/web-domain-list.rst


Installation
============

Create Workspace
----------------

First create a folder called ``Jenkins`` and a subfolder called ``Jenkins_home``.
Jenkins_home will hold all your Jenkins's data.

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ mkdir ~/Jenkins/Jenkins_home -p
 [isabell@stardust ~]$


Download Jenkins
-----------------

Next we download the current version of Jenkins:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ wget -O Jenkins/jenkins.war http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war/latest/jenkins.war
 --2019-05-24 15:33:32--  http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war/latest/jenkins.war

 [isabell@stardust ~]$


At this point you would already be able to run Jenkins, but you wouldn't be able to connect to it and it would not run as a service.

Configuration
==============

Install service
---------------

We create the service file ``~/etc/services.d/jenkins.ini`` and fill it with:

::

 [program:jenkins]
 directory=%(ENV_HOME)s/Jenkins/Jenkins_home
 command=java -jar ../jenkins.war


After that refresh and update the daemons and check if everything worked out:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ supervisorctl reread
 jenkins: available
 [isabell@stardust ~]$ supervisorctl update
 jenkins: added process group
 [isabell@stardust ~]$ supervisorctl status
 jenkins                          RUNNING   pid 4711, uptime 0:47:11
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Your Jenkins is now up and running as a service. 

Finally we'll setup our connection to the rest of the world.

Setup Web backend
-----------------

.. note::

    Jenkins is running on port 8080. 

.. include:: includes/web-backend.rst

Finishing Installation
======================

First connect and initial password
----------------------------------

Now you can go to ``https://isabell.uber.space`` and see the Jenkins asking for your initial password. It is stored in ``~/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword``.

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ cat ~/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
 SOMEHEXTHATIWONTTELLYOU
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Just copy and paste that and you'll be good to go. Just follow the setup and everything should work out.

Updates
=======

Do jump to a new version just replace the old war with the new version.
