Now we will configure the bot.
To set your TeamSpeak user as bot admin, you unique id is required.
Go to your TeamSpeak client and open the `Identities` window in the `Tools` menu.

The bot should now be connected.
Check it by connecting yourself to the server.

You can also test if the bot plays music by connecting to the bot's TeamSpeak channel and send it following private message:

::

 !play https://file-examples-com.github.io/uploads/2017/11/file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3

Because the TS3AudioBot program will be stopped if you disconnect your terminal, you need to configure a service.
Stop the bot by inserting ``Ctrl+C``.
Create ``~/etc/services.d/ts3audiobot.ini`` with following content:

.. code-block:: ini

 [program:ts3audiobot]
 command=dotnet TS3AudioBot.dll
 directory=/home/isabell/ts3audiobot/

.. include:: includes/supervisord.rst

Youtube Videos
==============

Playing youtube videos is currently not possible.
Therefore we need youtube-dl_.

First clone the repo:

::

 [isabell@stardust ts3audiobot]$ git clone https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl.git

Then configure the path in ``~/ts3audiobot/ts3audiobot.toml``, change

.. code-block:: toml

 youtube-dl = { path = "" }

to

.. code-block:: toml

 youtube-dl = { path = "./youtube-dl" }

Restart the bot to activate the new config:

::

 supervisorctl restart ts3audiobot

Test if you are now able to play youtube videos by sending ``!play <youtube url>`` to your bot.
