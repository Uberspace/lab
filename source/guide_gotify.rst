Gotify
######

.. tag_list::

Gotify_ is a self-hosted push notification service written in Go and distributed under the MIT License.
It consists of a server for sending and receiving messages in real-time per WebSocket which is distributed as a single binary. It can be accessed via the built-in web-ui, the `cli <https://github.com/gotify/cli>`_ or `the Android app <https://github.com/gotify/android>`_ (available via `F-Droid <https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.github.gotify/>`_ and `GooglePlay <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.gotify>`_ ).

.. note:: For this guide you should be familiar with the basic concepts of

  * :manual:`supervisord <daemons-supervisord>`
  * :manual:`domains <web-domains>`
  * :manual:`MySQL <database-mysql>` (optional)

Prerequisites
=============


Gotify comes with a built-in sqlite database, but if you prefer to use MySQL, you
can do so.

Gotify can run under a subdomain (e.g. https://gotify.isabella.uber.space) or via a subpath (e.g.
https://isabella.uber.space/gotify/).

For both options you need to configure a `web backend <webbackend_>`_.
The subpath option looks like this:

::

  [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace web backend set /gotify/ --http --port 52111 --remove-prefix
  Set backend for / to port 52111; please make sure something is listening!
  You can always check the status of your backend using "uberspace web backend list".
  [isabell@stardust ~]$

.. _webbackend: https://manual.uberspace.de/web-backends.html

Note the `--remove-prefix` option here. Without it, gotify will not work behind a sub path (e.g. `isabell.uber.space/gotify/`).


Installation
============

Like a lot of Go software, gotify is distributed as a single binary. Download gotify's latest `release <https://github.com/gotify/server/releases/latest>`_, unzip it and make sure that the file can be executed.

::

  [isabell@stardust ~]$ mkdir ~/gotify && cd ~/gotify
  [isabell@stardust gotify]$ wget https://github.com/gotify/server/releases/download/v2.0.10/gotify-linux-amd64.zip

Configuration
=============

Config file
-----------

Without configuration, gotify will listen on port 80. To change that to our previously chosen ``52111``,
we will use an environment variable. It is also possible to use a config file, but we will ignore that for now.
If you still want to change values in the config, download the example config and adjust it to your needs:

::

  [isabell@stardust gotify]$ wget -O config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gotify/server/master/config.example.yml
  [isabell@stardust gotify]$

Documentation for the config file can be found on the `gotify website <https://gotify.net/docs/config>`_.


Setup daemon
------------

Create ``~/etc/services.d/gotify.ini`` with the following content.

.. code-block:: ini

  [program:gotify]
  command=%(ENV_HOME)s/gotify/gotify-linux-amd64
  directory=%(ENV_HOME)s/gotify/
  environment=GOTIFY_SERVER_PORT=52111

.. include:: includes/supervisord.rst

If it's not in state RUNNING, check your configuration.

Finishing installation
======================

The default user and password is ``admin`` and ``admin``, but you are advised
to change in as soon as you log in. You can replace the admin user with an
other user with admin privileges later on.

Updates
=======

.. note:: Check the update feed_ regularly to stay informed about the newest version.

Check gotify's `releases <https://github.com/gotify/server/releases/latest>`_ for the latest version. If a newer
version is available, stop daemon by ``supervisorctl stop gotify`` and repeat the "Installation" step followed by ``supervisorctl start gotify`` to restart gotify.
