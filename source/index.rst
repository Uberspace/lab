Uberspace 7 Lab
###############

UberLab is a collection of how-to guides for Uberspace 7. It is meant as an addition to the Manual_, providing hands-on
guides on how to get popular (or even niche) software running on our platform. All articles are tested before
publication and will be maintained to ensure compatibility.

While most of the guides on this page are written by us, everybody is welcome to contribute new guides, changes to
existing ones, or even just a small issue to draw our attention to problems or missing guides. You can do so in the Lab's
`GitHub repository`_.

We hope that these guides not only enable you to install a certain software in your Uberspace, but that you might also learn something from them, giving you a better understanding of our system and Linux in general.

Thank you and have fun experimenting!
