 inflating: html/routes/channels.php
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Configuration
=============

Point your browser to your domain (e.g. isabell.uber.space) to set up and configure your Akaunting installation.

Step 1: Language Selection
--------------

Choose your desired language.

Step 2: Database Setup
--------------

Akaunting saves your data in a MySQL database. We suggest you use an `additional database`_. You need to create this database before you enter the database credentials in the installer.

.. code-block:: console
 :emphasize-lines: 1

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ mysql -e "CREATE  DATABASE isabell_akaunting"
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Enter the following informations into the installer:

  * your MySQL hostname, username and password: the hostname is ``localhost`` and you should know your MySQL credentials_ by now. If you don't, start reading again at the top.
  * the name of your newly created Akaunting database (e.g. ``isabell_akaunting``)

Step 3: Company and Admin Details
--------------

Fill in the name of your company, the company email adress (email sender if you send e.g. invoices), an admin email adress and your admin password.

**That's it.** After the installation you can login with your chosen admin credentials.

Usage
=======

There is a user manual available which describes the interface, concepts and workflows:

    * https://akaunting.com/docs


Updates
=======

.. note:: Check the update feed_ regularly to stay informed about the newest version.

You will be additionally notified about available updates in the built in notification center.
You can update the installation in the update wizzard which you can find in the Akaunting web interface.

.. warning:: Please note that third-party apps (plugins) need to be updated seperately. Available app updates are listed directly under the core updates. Make sure to check these regularly.
