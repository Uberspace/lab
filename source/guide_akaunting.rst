Prerequisites
=============

We're using PHP_ in the stable version 7.1:

::

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace tools version show php
 Using 'PHP' version: '7.1'
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

.. include:: includes/my-print-defaults.rst

Your domain needs to be set up:

.. include:: includes/web-domain-list.rst

 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Configuration
=============

Point your browser to your domain (e.g. isabell.uber.space) to set up and configure your Akaunting installation.

Step 1: Language Selection
--------------------------

Choose your desired language.

Step 2: Database Setup
----------------------

Akaunting saves your data in a MySQL database. We suggest you use an :manual_anchor:`additional database <database-mysql.html#additional-databases>`. You need to create this database before you enter the database credentials in the installer.

.. code-block:: console
 :emphasize-lines: 1

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ mysql -e "CREATE  DATABASE ${USER}_akaunting"
 [isabell@stardust ~]$

Enter the following information into the installer:

  * your MySQL hostname, username and password: the hostname is ``localhost`` and you should know your MySQL :manual_anchor:`credentials <database-mysql.html#login-credentials>` by now. If you don't, start reading again at the top.
  * the name of your newly created Akaunting database (e.g. ``isabell_akaunting``)

Step 3: Company and Admin Details
---------------------------------

Fill in the name of your company, the company email address (email sender if you send e.g. invoices), an admin email address and your admin password.

**That's it.** After the installation you can login with your chosen admin credentials.

Usage
=====

There is a user manual available which describes the interface, concepts and workflows:

=======

.. note:: Check the update feed_ regularly to stay informed about the newest version.

You will be additionally notified about available updates in the built in notification center.

.. warning:: Please note that third-party apps (plugins) need to be updated separately. Available app updates are listed directly under the core updates. Make sure to check these regularly.
