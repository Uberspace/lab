Pelican
#########

.. tag_list::

Pelican_ is a static site generator implemented in Python_ that combines Jinja templates with content written in Markdown or reStructuredText to produce websites.
The most prominent example is probably `kernel.org <https://www.kernel.org/pelican.html>`_
It is possible to `import <https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/importer.html>`_ an existing sites from Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogger and RSS/Atom feeds.
Pelican's source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican>`_ and it is an implementation of the static site generators concept.

Pelican was released for the first time in 2010 by Alexis MÃ©taireau.

Generate your website
=====================

Initialize
----------

Pelican comes with a handy quickstart wizard that creates the basic structure for you.
Run it inside a subfolder. In this guide, we'll use ``~/pelican``

:: 

  [isabell@stardust isabell]$ mkdir ~/pelican && cd ~/pelican
  [isabell@stardust pelican]$ pelican-quickstart

  Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.6.0.

  This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

  Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
  needed by Pelican.

  Done. Your new project is available at /home/isabell/pelican

  [isabell@stardust pelican]$ 


.. note:: In case you want to use a custom domain other than isabell.uber.space, you can enter it here or easily change it later in ``~/pelican/pelicanconf.py``

Prepare Publish
---------------

You need to modify ``~/pelican/Makefile`` to make sure the publish process is working correctly on your uberspace.

.. code-block:: diff
  :emphasize-lines: 3

  BASEDIR=$(CURDIR)
  INPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/content
  OUTPUTDIR=/var/www/virtual/$(USER)/html

Create Content
--------------

Now create your first blogpost by placing a markdown file in ``~/pelican/content/my-super-post.md``

::

  Title: My super title
  Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
  Modified: 2010-12-05 19:30
  Category: Python
  Tags: pelican, publishing
  Slug: my-super-post
  Authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle
  Summary: Short version for index and feeds

  This is the content of my 1st super blog post.

.. note:: More details how to write articles and pages can be found in the `official page <https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html>`_

Publish Content
---------------

To generate to final html files and publish them to your uberspace webserver, simply run 

::

  [isabell@stardust isabell]$ cd ~/pelican
  [isabell@stardust pelican]$ make publish

.. warning:: 

  This step will delete all content in ``~/html``, if any.

Then you can simply open `https://isabell.uber.space/ <https://isabell.uber.space/>`_

Configuration
==============

All configuration is done in two files. 
Please refer to the `official docs <https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html>`_ on how to customize them.

1. ``~/pelican/pelicanconf.py`` 
2. ``~/pelican/publishconf.py``


Themes
=======

To install a theme other than the default, please check the `official guide <https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/pelican-themes.html>`_.

You can simply choose one from `http://www.pelicanthemes.com/ <http://www.pelicanthemes.com/>`_ and run ``git clone``
In this example I am using the theme maned ``Flex`` 

::

  [isabell@stardust isabell]$ cd ~/pelican
  [isabell@stardust pelican]$ git clone git@github.com:alexandrevicenzi/Flex.git theme

Then add following line to you ``~/pelican/pelicanconf.py``

:: 

  THEME = "theme"
